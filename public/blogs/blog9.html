                <section data-scroll-reveal="enter from-left">
                    <p>Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a household term in the digital age. From charging our smartphones to connecting printers, USB technology has become indispensable. But have you ever wondered about the differences between USB-A, USB-B, and USB-C? Why were they developed, and how do they shape modern technology? This blog will unravel the history, purpose, and uses of each USB type, empowering you with knowledge about the connectors that keep our devices running.</p>

                <!-- Section 1 -->
                <section data-scroll-reveal="enter from-left">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Beginning: The Birth of USB</h3>
                    <p>The USB standard was introduced in 1996 by a group of seven companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Compaq. Their goal was simple yet revolutionary: create a standardized, universal interface to simplify the connection between computers and peripherals. Before USB, connecting devices often required specific ports and drivers, leading to compatibility issues and consumer frustration.</p>
                    <p>USB revolutionized connectivity by providing a plug-and-play experience, eliminating the need for device-specific adapters and software. It quickly became the industry standard, with USB 1.0 offering a modest data transfer rate of 12 Mbps.</p>

                    <!-- USB-A Section -->
                    <h4>USB-A: The Classic Connector</h4>
                    <img src="/images/blog9.usba.webp" alt="USB-A Connector" class="w-full h-40 object-contain rounded-lg mb-4">
                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Rectangular with a flat design.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> USB-A was the original standard and remains widely used for connecting devices like keyboards, mice, and flash drives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Development:</strong> USB-A emerged alongside the first USB specifications to replace outdated interfaces like serial ports.</p>
                    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> One major drawback of USB-A is its non-reversible design, which often leads to the “three-try rule” when plugging it in.</p>
                
                    <!-- USB-B Section -->
                    <h4>USB-B: The Peripherals Specialist</h4>

                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> USB-B connectors were designed primarily for peripherals such as printers, scanners, and external hard drives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Development:</strong> Introduced as a companion to USB-A, USB-B standardized the connection between host devices (like PCs) and peripherals.</p>
                    <p><strong>Evolution:</strong> Over time, variations like Mini-B and Micro-B were developed to cater to smaller devices, including digital cameras and early smartphones.</p>
                
                    <!-- USB-C Section -->
                    <h4>USB-C: The Modern Marvel</h4>
                    <img src="/images/blog9.usbc.webp" alt="USB-C Connector" class="w-full h-40 object-contain rounded-lg mb-4">
                    <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Slim, oval-shaped, and symmetrical.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> USB-C is the latest and most versatile connector, offering faster data transfer, higher power delivery, and reversibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Development:</strong> USB-C was introduced in 2014 by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) to address the growing demands of modern devices for faster speeds, higher power output, and universal compatibility.</p>
