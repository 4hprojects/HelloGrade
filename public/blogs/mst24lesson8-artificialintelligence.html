                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Artificial Intelligence is not a one-size-fits-all technology. It comes in different types, each with its own capabilities and limitations. AI can be categorized based on its ability to learn, adapt, and perform tasks, ranging from simple rule-based systems to advanced self-learning models.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Reactive AI</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Reactive AI is the most basic type of artificial intelligence. It operates solely based on predefined rules and does not store past experiences or learn from them. These systems analyze input and provide output without improving over time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Example: IBM’s Deep Blue, the chess-playing AI that defeated world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, was a reactive AI. It could evaluate chess positions and make moves but had no memory or learning capability.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Limited Memory AI</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Unlike reactive AI, limited memory AI can learn from past experiences and use that information to make decisions. It relies on historical data to improve its accuracy and performance over time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Example: Self-driving cars use limited memory AI to observe road conditions, traffic patterns, and pedestrian movements. They analyze real-time data and make driving decisions based on previous observations.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Theory of Mind AI (Emerging)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Theory of Mind AI is still in development. This type of AI aims to understand human emotions, intentions, and thought processes. It could enable machines to engage in deeper human-like interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Potential uses: AI-powered virtual therapists, emotionally intelligent chatbots, and advanced customer service systems that can respond to users based on emotional cues.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Self-Aware AI (Hypothetical)</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Self-aware AI is the most advanced and currently hypothetical form of artificial intelligence. This type of AI would possess consciousness, self-awareness, and the ability to understand its existence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        While self-aware AI is a concept explored in science fiction, researchers debate whether achieving true machine consciousness is even possible. Currently, this remains a theoretical discussion rather than a practical reality.
                    </p>
    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-6 mb-2">Narrow AI vs. General AI</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        AI can also be classified based on its scope and capabilities. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform a single specific task, while General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aims to mimic human intelligence across a wide range of tasks.
                    </p>
    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4 mb-2">Narrow AI (Weak AI)</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Narrow AI specializes in one area and cannot function beyond its programming. It is the most common type of AI used today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Examples: Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems on Netflix and YouTube, and AI-powered fraud detection in banking.
                    </p>
    
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-600 mt-4 mb-2">General AI (Strong AI)</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        General AI is a theoretical form of AI that would possess human-like intelligence and be capable of reasoning, problem-solving, and learning across multiple disciplines without specific programming.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
