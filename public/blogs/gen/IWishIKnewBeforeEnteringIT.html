    “Everybody in this country should learn to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.” — <em>Steve Jobs</em><br><br>
    And yet, no one tells you how hard it is to start.<br><br>
    The world of Information Technology isn’t just about coding and fixing hardware. It’s deadlines. It’s imposter syndrome. It’s late-night debugging and learning things on the fly while everyone assumes you know everything because you're "the tech person."<br><br>
    Here’s a number to consider: <strong>nearly 50% of IT graduates admit they felt unprepared during their first job</strong>. Not because they lacked technical skills—but because no one prepared them for the realities of working in tech.<br><br>
    If you're planning to enter the IT industry—or you’re already in it and wondering if you’re the only one feeling lost—you’re not alone. I’ve been there. And if I could go back, I’d do a few things differently.<br><br>
    In this article, I’ll break down <strong>10 real, practical things I wish someone told me before I entered the world of IT</strong>. Whether you're a student, a career shifter, or someone looking to stay ahead, these insights will help you thrive—not just survive.<br><br>
    No fluff. Just what you need to know to succeed.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Problem Solving is Key</h3>
                    <p>Programming is not just about writing code—it’s about solving problems. Every IT challenge, from debugging code to optimizing systems, requires strong problem-solving skills. Developing this mindset early can make your IT journey less daunting and more rewarding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Break problems into smaller pieces. Draw diagrams, explain your approach to someone else, or even jot down steps on paper. Clarity in thought leads to clarity in execution.</p>

                    <p>Success in IT isn’t about being a genius—it’s about persistence. Bugs will frustrate you, systems will fail, and there will be times when solutions seem elusive. The ability to keep going despite setbacks is what sets successful IT professionals apart.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Programming is often described as 10% writing code and 90% debugging. Mastering debugging is where you truly learn to code.</p>

                    <p>In IT, what you can do often matters more than what you know. While academic knowledge lays a solid foundation, the industry values real-world experience. Building projects, contributing to open-source software, or experimenting with new technologies can make you stand out.</p>
                    <p><strong>Actionable Advice:</strong> Start building your portfolio early. Showcase projects that demonstrate your skills and initiative, such as web apps, scripts, or system designs.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Continuous Practice is Non-Negotiable</h3>
                    <p>Programming is like any other skill—you improve with practice. The more problems you tackle, the better you get. Platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode are excellent for honing your skills and preparing for technical interviews.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Dedicate time daily to coding, even if it’s just an hour. Regular practice sharpens your thinking and improves familiarity with common programming patterns.</p>

                    <p>The IT field isn’t just about technical expertise. Communication, teamwork, and adaptability play vital roles in career success. Whether you’re debugging with a team or presenting a project to stakeholders, soft skills amplify your technical abilities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Join communities, attend meetups, or participate in hackathons to enhance your interpersonal skills while building your network.</p>

                    <p>While grades can help you land your first internship, they quickly lose importance in the IT world. What matters more are your skills, projects, and practical experience. Similarly, unless extracurricular activities align with your career goals, they may not significantly impact your job prospects.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Focus on activities that build your IT expertise, such as coding clubs, tech competitions, or certifications.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. The Industry Moves Faster Than Academia</h3>
                    <p>Universities often teach fundamentals, but the IT industry evolves rapidly. Tools like React, Docker, and AWS may not be covered in traditional courses but are critical in real-world applications. Staying updated with industry trends is essential.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proactive Approach:</strong> Learn independently through platforms like YouTube, Udemy, or Coursera. Staying curious and proactive will keep you ahead.</p>

                    <p>IT professionals often say, “The solution to any problem is only a Google search away.” This highlights the importance of resourcefulness and perseverance. Don’t shy away from using forums, documentation, or online communities when stuck.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Effective Googling is a skill. Learn to phrase your queries specifically to find precise solutions.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Debugging: The Real IT Skill</h3>
                    <p>Many believe that programming is about writing flawless code. In reality, debugging teaches you more than coding itself. It forces you to understand your program deeply and think critically.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Embrace debugging. Use tools like breakpoints and log statements to dissect your code systematically.</p>

                    <p>Software engineering is the most visible IT role, but it’s not the only one. The field offers numerous opportunities, from UX/UI design and product management to data analysis and system architecture. Exploring these paths can help you find what resonates most with you.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Research roles through informational interviews, job shadowing, or internships. Align your career goals with your strengths and interests.</p>
