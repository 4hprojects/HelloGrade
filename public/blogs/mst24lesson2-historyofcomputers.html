<section >
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mt-8 mb-4">Mechanical Wonders of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment</h3>
    <p>
        The period from the <strong>14th to the 18th century</strong> was a time of immense scientific growth and exploration. As scholars sought to refine mathematical and computational methods, 
        <strong>mechanical devices</strong> emerged to aid in calculations. These inventions paved the way for the future of programmable machines.
    </p>

    <!-- Pascal's Pascaline -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6">Pascal’s Pascaline: The First Mechanical Calculator</h4>
    <p>
        In the <strong>1640s</strong>, French mathematician <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong> invented the <strong>Pascaline</strong>, one of the earliest mechanical calculators. 
        Designed to help his father with tax calculations, the Pascaline could perform <strong>addition and subtraction</strong> through a system of gears and dials.
    </p>
    <p>
        While limited in function, the Pascaline was a <strong>significant leap</strong> in automated computation, showing that machines could be designed to handle mathematical operations.

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6">Leibniz’s Stepped Reckoner: Expanding Mechanical Computation</h4>
    <p>
        Inspired by Pascal’s work, German polymath <strong>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong> developed the <strong>Stepped Reckoner</strong> in the <strong>1670s</strong>. 
        Unlike the Pascaline, the Stepped Reckoner could perform <strong>multiplication and division</strong> using a stepped drum mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Leibniz was also an early advocate of <strong>binary numbers</strong>, an essential concept in modern computing. His vision of a universal system of computation anticipated today’s digital logic.

    <!-- Babbage's Analytical Engine -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6">Babbage’s Analytical Engine: The First Programmable Computer</h4>
    <p>
        In the <strong>19th century</strong>, British mathematician <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> designed the <strong>Analytical Engine</strong>, 
        a mechanical device that could perform a wide range of calculations. Unlike its predecessors, it was <strong>programmable</strong> using <strong>punched cards</strong>, 
        a method borrowed from the textile industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Analytical Engine included components resembling modern computers:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
        <li><strong>The Store</strong> – Functioned like memory for storing numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>The Mill</strong> – Performed arithmetic calculations (similar to a CPU).</li>
        <li><strong>Punched Cards</strong> – Provided instructions for operation.</li>

    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6">Ada Lovelace: The First Computer Programmer</h4>
    <p>
        Babbage’s collaborator, <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>, is considered the <strong>first computer programmer</strong>. 
        She recognized that the Analytical Engine could do more than just crunch numbers—it could manipulate <strong>symbols</strong> and <strong>generate complex sequences</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In her notes, she wrote what is considered the <strong>first algorithm</strong> intended for execution by a machine. 
        Her vision foreshadowed the idea of general-purpose computing.

        The 20th century marked a major transformation in computing. Computers evolved from mechanical devices to powerful electronic machines, 
        enabling faster and more complex calculations. This period saw the invention of vacuum tube computers, the Turing Machine, 
        and early general-purpose electronic computers like ENIAC.
    </p>

    <!-- The Development of the Vacuum Tube -->
    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-6">The Development of the Vacuum Tube</h4>
    <p>
        In 1904, British scientist John Ambrose Fleming introduced the vacuum tube (thermionic valve). 
        Initially used for converting electrical signals in radios, it soon became an essential component in early electronic computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The vacuum tube functioned as an electronic switch, replacing mechanical relays. This led to faster computation 
        and allowed the development of fully electronic computers.
