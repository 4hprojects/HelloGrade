            <p>
                To truly appreciate the marvels of modern computing, it’s crucial to start with the basics. 
                <strong>Computer hardware</strong> refers to the tangible components that power your system, enabling software to perform everything from simple calculations to complex programming tasks. 
                Whether it’s a sleek laptop for work or a high-performance gaming PC, every computer relies on a carefully orchestrated network of 
                <strong>basic components of computer hardware</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What makes hardware essential?</strong><br>
                Hardware acts as the backbone of a computer system, providing the physical infrastructure for running programs and processing data. 
                Without hardware like the <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>, <strong>RAM (Random Access Memory)</strong>, or <strong>Motherboard</strong>, a computer simply cannot function.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Input Components:</strong> Devices like the <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>mouse</strong> allow users to interact with the system, feeding it commands and data.</li>
                <li><strong>Processing Units:</strong> The <strong>CPU</strong> takes center stage, handling billions of operations per second.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> The <strong>monitor</strong> translates the machine's processes into visual outputs for users to interpret.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> From <strong>HDDs</strong> to <strong>SSDs</strong>, storage ensures your data is safe and accessible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Understanding these <strong>types of computer hardware</strong> lays a strong foundation for diving into more advanced topics like 
                <strong>hardware installation</strong> or <strong>computer networking</strong>. As we explore each component in detail, you’ll see how these pieces work together to create a seamless computing experience.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Core Components of Computer Hardware</h3>
            <p>
                At the heart of every computer lies a group of vital <strong>computer hardware components</strong> that drive its functionality. Understanding these 
                <strong>basic components of computer hardware</strong> not only helps in troubleshooting but also empowers you to make smarter upgrade decisions. Let’s delve into the essential parts that form the core of any system:
            </p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">CPU: The Brain of the Computer</h4>
            <div class="flex justify-center mb-6">
                <img src="/images/mst24-lesson3/ai-processor.png" alt="Processor (CPU)" class="rounded-lg shadow-md">
            </div>
            <p>
                The <strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong> is often described as the “brain” of the computer. Why? Because it processes all instructions from software and hardware. 
                From running your favorite apps to executing complex <strong>computer programming</strong> tasks, the CPU handles it all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early CPUs like the Intel 4004 could execute just 92,000 instructions per second. Compare that to today’s processors, such as the AMD Ryzen or Intel Core series, which operate at billions of instructions per second across multiple cores. 
                This leap in power has transformed how we multitask, enabling seamless gaming, video editing, and even AI-powered applications.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">Key Takeaway: The speed and performance of a CPU directly influence your computer's ability to handle demanding tasks, making it a critical component in any system build.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Motherboard: The Central Hub</h4>
            
            <div class="flex justify-center mb-6">
                <img src="/images/mst24-lesson3/ai-motherboard.png" alt="Motherboard" class="rounded-lg shadow-md">
            </div>
            <p>
                If the CPU is the brain, the <strong>motherboard</strong> is the nervous system, connecting every piece of hardware to work as a cohesive unit. 
                The <strong>motherboard</strong> serves as the platform where components like the <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong>graphics card</strong>, and <strong>storage devices</strong> communicate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Modern motherboards offer advanced features like built-in Wi-Fi, high-speed PCIe slots for GPUs, and support for the latest memory standards. For example, ASUS ROG motherboards are popular in gaming setups for their robust performance and versatility.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">Tip for Beginners: Choosing a motherboard compatible with your CPU and other components is crucial for smooth operation.</p>

        </div>
        <p>
            A <strong>graphics card</strong>, also known as a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is designed to handle visual rendering tasks. 
            While CPUs can manage basic graphics, GPUs excel at rendering complex visuals and processing large datasets simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern GPUs, such as NVIDIA's RTX series or AMD's Radeon RX line, are essential for gaming, animation, and other intensive applications. 
            They also play a critical role in AI computations and <strong>computer networking</strong> for tasks like video streaming.
