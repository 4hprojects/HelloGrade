            <p>
                While 5G focuses on enhanced mobile broadband and IoT integration, 6G promises to push boundaries even further. Here are the core differences between the two:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Speed:</strong> 
                    <span>5G offers maximum download speeds of up to 10 Gbps, while 6G is expected to reach speeds of 1 Tbpsâ€”100 times faster than 5G. Imagine downloading an entire library of movies in just seconds.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Latency:</strong> 
                    <span>5G latency ranges between 1-10 ms, but 6G aims to drop below 1 ms, enabling real-time responses for critical applications like remote surgeries and tactile internet.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Frequency Bands:</strong> 
                    <span>5G operates within sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands. In contrast, 6G will leverage terahertz frequencies, unlocking new possibilities for ultra-high-speed data transfers.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Applications:</strong> 
                    <span>5G use cases include smart cities, IoT devices, and augmented reality, whereas 6G introduces holographic communications, brain-computer interfaces, and AI-driven networks.</span>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <section >
            <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4">Smart Cities: Building Dynamic Urban Ecosystems</h4>
            <p>
                6G will empower cities to become smarter, greener, and more efficient. Leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) on an unprecedented scale, urban systems for energy, water, and waste can adapt in real time to changing demands. For example, 6G-enabled sensors could detect leaks in water pipelines, reroute traffic to prevent jams, or optimise energy distribution based on peak usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                These advancements will reduce resource wastage and improve the quality of life for residents, making cities more sustainable and resilient. By integrating real-time data into everyday systems, 6G connectivity has the potential to transform urban environments into dynamic ecosystems.

            <p>
                Despite its promise, the journey to 6G is not without hurdles. For the technology to achieve its transformative potential, several critical challenges must be addressed:
            </p>
            <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4">Infrastructure Upgrades</h4>
            <p>
                The rollout of 6G will demand a complete overhaul of existing telecommunications infrastructure. New base stations capable of handling terahertz frequencies must be built, alongside advanced edge computing facilities to process data closer to the user. This massive undertaking requires significant investments from governments, telecom operators, and private entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the transition will need careful planning to ensure compatibility with existing systems, minimizing disruptions during the shift. Coordinating infrastructure upgrades at a global scale will be a monumental task, requiring both collaboration and innovation.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 8 -->
        <section >
            <h4 class="font-semibold mt-4">Energy Consumption</h4>
            <p>
                As data rates and device connectivity scale up, so will the demand for energy. The deployment of terahertz frequencies and dense 6G networks could lead to a surge in power consumption, posing challenges to sustainability goals. Without energy-efficient solutions, the environmental impact of 6G could overshadow its benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Researchers are already exploring innovative technologies like energy harvesting, low-power IoT devices, and renewable energy-powered base stations to address this issue. Achieving a balance between performance and sustainability will be critical for the success of 6G networks.
