        “More than <strong>550 million people</strong> now use ChatGPT every month.” That number alone tells you something important—AI has quietly become part of our daily workflow. 
        Whether you’re a developer, student, or educator, the real question isn’t <em>if</em> you should use it. It’s <em>how</em> you’re using it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Since its launch in late 2022, ChatGPT has evolved from a simple text generator into an intelligent assistant capable of deep research, image generation, voice interaction, and even project management.
        In 2025, it’s not just a chatbot. It’s an ecosystem—one that combines <strong>GPTs, Agent Mode, Projects, Codex, and Sora</strong> into a single workspace where you can research, code, analyse, and build.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        This guide isn’t about showing every button. It’s about showing you what actually works. 
        You’ll learn how to use <strong>Deep Research</strong> to collect verified insights, automate tasks through <strong>Agent Mode</strong>, manage data with <strong>Projects</strong>, and code directly inside <strong>Canvas</strong>—all without leaving the interface.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        You’ll also see how to protect your privacy, control memory, and integrate ChatGPT with your favourite tools.

        Understanding ChatGPT’s 2025 Interface and Core Features
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        When you open ChatGPT today, you’re not just greeted by a text box—you’re stepping into a full workspace designed for research, creation, and collaboration. The interface now brings together chat, image, and voice interactions in one window. 
        Everything you need to brainstorm, code, analyse, or publish is right where you type.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        On the left sidebar, you’ll see <strong>GPTs</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, and <strong>Tools</strong>. Each one serves a different purpose:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-800 leading-7">
        <li><strong>GPTs</strong> – Customised versions of ChatGPT tailored for specific tasks like writing, analysis, design, or finance.</li>
        <li><strong>Projects</strong> – A workspace that keeps your related files, research, and chats together for long-term tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Agent Mode</strong> – Executes real actions like generating mockups, deploying websites, or running scheduled tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Research</strong> – Conducts in-depth research using multiple online and academic sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Codex</strong> – The dedicated coding model for developers, ideal for generating, explaining, or debugging code.</li>
        <li><strong>Sora</strong> – ChatGPT’s image and video generation feature for creating visuals and storyboards.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The <strong>default model</strong> for most users is <strong>GPT-5</strong>, but depending on your plan, you can access specialised models like Codex for programming or Sora for media generation. 
        These models don’t just respond—they understand context, interpret images, process documents, and even interact through voice.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        You can now upload files, drag images directly into the chat, and dictate prompts using the new <strong>voice mode</strong>. 
        On mobile, this feels even more natural—just talk, and ChatGPT listens, responds, and follows up in real time.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        What makes this version different is how seamlessly it combines tools. You can ask it to summarise a PDF, then tell it to visualise the data, and within seconds, turn those insights into a dashboard or even a React app—all without switching tabs. 
        It’s a single flow from concept to output.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        Before you explore advanced functions like <strong>Agent Mode</strong> or <strong>Deep Research</strong>, get comfortable with the interface. 
        Think of it as your new control panel—where your prompts, projects, and personalisation settings all come together.

        Chat Feature: Where Conversations Turn Into Real Work
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Most users start by typing a question or request, but in 2025, ChatGPT’s chat feature is far more than just text replies. 
        It recognises tone, intent, and structure—then responds with clarity, data, or action. It’s fast, contextual, and flexible enough 
        to switch between research, writing, and problem-solving without missing a beat.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        You can still use it like a search engine—ask about trending technologies or product recommendations—but the real power appears 
        when you go beyond surface-level questions. For example, a marketer can say, 
        <em>“Tell a historical story that can help me sell running shoes.”</em> ChatGPT connects the prompt with context, generating 
        a compelling narrative around the ancient marathon messenger Pheidippides, complete with emotional cues and taglines. 
        Then, with one follow-up command, it can turn that story into a cinematic 60-second ad script. 
        That’s the difference between asking and creating.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The chat interface now allows you to upload photos, PDFs, and spreadsheets directly into the conversation. 
        ChatGPT reads the content, extracts meaning, and presents results in an organised way. 
        You can even combine multiple files—like an article, a CSV file, and a PDF—and ask for a unified analysis. 
        Instead of jumping between apps, you’re analysing, visualising, and building inside a single chat window.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The system also remembers context within a project. 
        When paired with the <strong>Projects</strong> feature, ChatGPT keeps all related materials, instructions, and outputs in one place. 
        It understands your previous questions, improving continuity in your workflow. 
        Whether you’re planning a research paper or managing an app prototype, every conversation remains part of the same thread of work.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        ChatGPT’s chat feature has become the new workspace for modern professionals—where words lead to designs, code, data, and insight. 
        Once you learn to use it for creation instead of just consultation, it stops feeling like a chatbot and starts functioning like a collaborator.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4 text-left">
        Deep Research: Turning Curiosity Into Verified Insight
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Research once meant juggling tabs, summarising reports, and verifying data by hand. 
        With <strong>Deep Research</strong>, ChatGPT automates that process while keeping full transparency about its sources. 
        You can now instruct it to create a report on any topic—like “dating trends in North America from 2020 to 2025”—and it will perform 
        structured searches, cross-check data, and return a multi-page summary with key statistics and verified citations.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        What makes this feature different from a simple search is how it tailors results through conversation. 
        ChatGPT asks clarifying questions before it begins, such as the target region, demographic range, or whether you prefer qualitative or quantitative data. 
        It behaves more like a research assistant who knows how to frame your objectives before collecting the facts. 
        Once complete, it provides a breakdown of findings, charts, and trend summaries drawn from credible web sources.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        For example, a student studying behavioural technology can request an analysis of global app usage habits among Gen Z. 
        ChatGPT then runs an in-depth search, compiles the data, and delivers an interactive report—highlighting shifts in preferences, 
        engagement patterns, and year-over-year growth. The result feels closer to a market brief than a chatbot response.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Each <strong>Deep Research</strong> session is transparent. 
        You can view how many sources it consulted, which ones contributed to the final output, and how the information was structured. 
        This transparency matters, especially for academic and professional use, where credibility outweighs convenience.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        Whether you’re compiling data for a thesis, validating facts for a report, or preparing a lecture, 
        Deep Research helps you focus on interpretation instead of collection. It’s research that finally keeps up with your pace of thought.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4 text-left">
        Agent Mode: From Conversation to Action
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        If you’ve ever wished ChatGPT could go beyond talking and actually <strong>do</strong> things for you, that’s exactly what <strong>Agent Mode</strong> delivers. 
        It’s where prompts turn into workflows. This feature allows ChatGPT to execute real tasks — generating mockups, deploying websites, organising files, or scheduling recurring actions. 
        Think of it as giving your AI the power to work like a digital assistant who doesn’t just advise, but acts.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        To activate Agent Mode, you simply toggle it within a project or task. 
        Once enabled, ChatGPT can follow complex, multi-step instructions — for example, you could ask it to “redesign my website based on the layout suggestions you gave earlier” 
        and then watch it produce a working HTML draft complete with structure, colours, and text hierarchy. 
        From there, you can even deploy it directly to <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> without leaving the interface.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        One of the most useful applications of Agent Mode is automation. 
        You can schedule reminders, generate reports at fixed intervals, or assign ChatGPT to gather weekly analytics from connected tools. 
        These agents can perform repeatable tasks such as fetching data, summarising progress, or sending updates to your inbox.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        In education and development settings, Agent Mode simplifies repetitive work. 
        Teachers can automate quiz generation, while developers can set up recurring code reviews or test reports. 
        Every instruction runs within a contained environment, so it remains secure while giving you full control over what actions the agent can take.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        The result is a feature that saves hours each week. 
        You’re no longer limited to what ChatGPT can explain — you’re leveraging what it can <em>build</em>, <em>deploy</em>, and <em>maintain</em>. 
        That’s the real shift from chat to automation — from assistant to co-worker.

        Projects: Keeping Your Work Organised and Connected
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        When conversations start to stretch across multiple topics, files, and objectives, <strong>Projects</strong> help you keep everything in order. 
        This feature functions like a workspace inside ChatGPT where all your related chats, research, documents, and instructions stay linked together. 
        It turns scattered interactions into a single, organised workflow.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Creating a project is simple. Give it a name — for instance, <em>Investing</em> or <em>Capstone Research</em> — then upload your source files such as PDFs, 
        CSV data, or notes. You can set guiding rules like “keep answers grounded in actual data” or “always list pros and cons.” 
        These instructions help ChatGPT tailor its responses and maintain consistency across sessions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The advantage of Projects is continuity. Instead of reminding ChatGPT about your topic every time, 
        it automatically remembers your context within that project. Whether you return hours or days later, it recalls the same datasets, 
        tone, and objectives — allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Professionals often use this for market analysis, academic research, and content planning. 
        For example, an educator can upload lesson outlines, sample quizzes, and a grading rubric to create a full teaching assistant project. 
        A developer might store technical specifications and documentation to use ChatGPT as a live code reviewer. 
        Every project becomes a dedicated AI workspace customised to your goals.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        <strong>Projects</strong> transform ChatGPT from a chat app into an organised hub for long-term work. 
        Whether you’re managing course content, conducting research, or building applications, 
        it keeps your workflow clear, your data structured, and your progress accessible in one place.

        Codex: The Developer’s Integrated Coding Partner
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Coding inside ChatGPT is no longer limited to snippets and explanations. 
        The <strong>Codex</strong> model transforms the chat environment into a development workspace capable of reading, generating, and analysing code in real time. 
        It connects directly to your GitHub repositories, allowing you to understand project structures, review commits, and even automate fixes or documentation.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        For example, you can upload a project and ask, 
        <em>“Explain the purpose of each module and identify where sensitive credentials might exist.”</em> 
        Codex responds with a clear breakdown of directories, functions, and potential risks. 
        It’s especially helpful when joining new teams or maintaining legacy codebases — what used to take hours of reading now takes minutes.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Codex isn’t just for analysis. You can build directly inside it. 
        Typing <code>code a simple Pomodoro app</code> generates a working prototype that you can preview through <strong>Canvas</strong> and push to GitHub with one click. 
        Developers can also run <strong>code reviews</strong> and receive recommendations aligned with clean code principles or security practices.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The integration with <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and other IDEs means you can switch between conversation and development without losing context. 
        It’s a coding partner that documents as it builds, explains logic, and adapts to your stack — whether it’s Python, Java, JavaScript, or Node.js.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        Codex represents the new era of pair programming. 
        Instead of coding alone, you’re working alongside an assistant that understands syntax, logic, and your intent. 
        It helps debug faster, write cleaner code, and focus on solving problems rather than fighting errors.

        Sora: Bringing Ideas to Life Through Image and Video Generation
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Visual content has become a central part of communication, and <strong>Sora</strong> is ChatGPT’s answer to that demand. 
        It allows you to generate images and videos directly within the ChatGPT interface. 
        Whether you’re designing marketing materials, creating educational diagrams, or visualising creative concepts, Sora transforms text prompts into high-quality visuals in seconds.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        You can describe a scene, character, or product concept — for instance, 
        <em>“A modern classroom with students coding on laptops under warm lighting”</em> — and Sora produces a ready-to-use image or short clip that fits your description. 
        Each output can be adjusted by refining your prompt or by using the built-in <strong>edit, remix, and loop</strong> tools. 
        It’s the fastest way to create visual prototypes without design software.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Educators can generate instructional materials, UI designers can preview interface mockups, and content creators can storyboard their next video or campaign. 
        Sora also supports sequence-based storytelling — where multiple prompts can be chained together to build animated clips or narrative visualisations.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        While early versions of AI visuals felt mechanical, Sora’s 2025 model produces natural textures, lighting, and composition. 
        You can even blend elements, such as <em>“a realistic product photo combined with a cinematic background”</em>. 
        It’s built for experimentation, helping you move from imagination to presentation faster than ever before.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        Sora blurs the line between creator and editor. 
        It gives you the ability to illustrate ideas instantly, replacing long design cycles with iterative visual feedback. 
        When paired with <strong>Agent Mode</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong>, it becomes part of a seamless creative process — from prompt to production.

        Schedules, Memory, and Data Controls: Personalising the Way You Work
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Productivity isn’t just about creating faster — it’s about managing smarter. 
        ChatGPT’s 2025 version integrates <strong>Schedules</strong>, <strong>Memory</strong>, and <strong>Data Controls</strong> 
        to help you automate reminders, personalise interactions, and decide what information your AI retains.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The <strong>Schedules</strong> feature works like a built-in task manager. 
        You can ask ChatGPT to remind you of something, perform research at a set interval, or send automated updates. 
        For example, saying <em>“Remind me every Monday at 9 AM to gather weekly project analytics”</em> 
        creates a recurring task that runs automatically — no external app required. 
        These schedules are particularly helpful for educators, managers, or developers who track repeating workflows.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        <strong>Memory</strong> is where ChatGPT becomes truly personalised. 
        It learns key details you choose to share — such as your name, projects, or preferred writing tone — 
        so it can respond more accurately over time. You can update or clear these memories anytime, 
        giving you complete control over how much context the AI retains.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        In <strong>Data Controls</strong>, you can manage what ChatGPT can use for training or reference. 
        You can disable content sharing, export your chat data, or even delete stored conversations permanently. 
        The <strong>Security</strong> settings also allow for multi-factor authentication and device management, 
        ensuring that your data stays private while maintaining flexibility.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        These features turn ChatGPT into a system that adapts to you — not the other way around. 
        You decide what it remembers, what it automates, and what it forgets. 
        Whether you’re using it for coursework, research, or business, 
        having this level of personal control helps you maintain both productivity and privacy.

        Playground and Agents SDK: Building the Next Generation of AI Tools
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        Beyond chat and automation, <strong>Playground</strong> and <strong>Agents SDK</strong> are where ChatGPT graduates from being a conversational assistant to a development platform. 
        These tools are designed for creators, developers, and advanced users who want to prototype, test, and deploy AI-powered systems with precision and control.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The <strong>OpenAI Playground</strong> lets you interact directly with GPT models using a simplified programming environment. 
        You can customise system prompts, set temperature levels, and fine-tune the way ChatGPT responds. 
        It’s ideal for testing model behaviour, experimenting with different instructions, or developing specialised assistants. 
        Developers can switch models, connect APIs, and adjust variables — all in real time.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        For teams building larger systems, the <strong>Agents SDK</strong> takes it further. 
        It’s a full development framework that allows you to build, evaluate, and deploy AI agents that perform structured tasks independently. 
        Think of it as the foundation for custom AI tools — from customer support bots to intelligent research systems or teaching assistants that can handle multi-step reasoning.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-4">
        The SDK supports advanced configurations such as vector storage, function calling, and API chaining. 
        This means your agents can store data, retrieve information, and interact with multiple services simultaneously. 
        Developers can evaluate agent performance using built-in metrics and iterate based on test results — all within the OpenAI platform.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-7">
        Together, <strong>Playground</strong> and <strong>Agents SDK</strong> mark the transition from using ChatGPT as a personal assistant to treating it as an engineering framework. 
        You can now design your own AI systems, control their responses, and integrate them into your real-world applications — bridging the gap between learning AI and building with it.
