                    <p>
                        Cybersecurity is more than just a tech buzzword; it’s the backbone of our interconnected world. At its core, cybersecurity involves protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Think of it as the digital shield safeguarding everything from your email password to a multinational corporation's trade secrets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does this matter? Because every device, every app, and every byte of data online is a potential target. Cybersecurity measures ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, forming the foundation of trust in today’s digital ecosystem.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                        <li><strong>Network Security:</strong> Safeguarding networks from breaches and unauthorized access.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Ensuring sensitive information stays confidential and intact.</li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Compliance and Legal Responsibility:</strong> Failing to protect data can lead to severe penalties under regulations like GDPR or the Data Privacy Act. Cybersecurity isn’t just good practice—it’s the law in many sectors.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Beyond organisations, individuals are equally at risk. Cybersecurity protects personal data, financial assets, and even your identity from falling into the wrong hands. It’s the armour we all need in the battle against digital threats.

                                <strong>White Hat Hackers:</strong> Also known as ethical hackers, they work with organisations to find and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Their work strengthens cybersecurity defenses.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Gray Hat Hackers:</strong> Operating in the moral grey area, these hackers identify vulnerabilities without permission but don’t necessarily exploit them for malicious purposes. They may notify system owners of the flaws—or not.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Script Kiddies:</strong> Amateur hackers who rely on pre-written scripts or tools created by others. They often lack deep technical knowledge and target low-hanging vulnerabilities for amusement or notoriety.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Hacking methods vary widely, from exploiting software vulnerabilities to guessing weak passwords or using social engineering tactics to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. As technology advances, so do the techniques hackers use to bypass defenses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The line between ethical and malicious hacking is clear: intent. While ethical hacking seeks to protect, malicious hacking exploits systems for gain or destruction. As cybersecurity evolves, combating hacking remains a critical priority for individuals, organisations, and governments alike.

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">What is Malware?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorised access to computer systems. It’s a broad term that encompasses various types of harmful programs, each with its own devastating impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are the most common types of malware:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Viruses:</strong> Attach themselves to legitimate programs or files and spread when the infected file is executed. Viruses can corrupt data, slow down systems, or crash networks.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Worms:</strong> Self-replicating malware that spreads without needing a host program. Worms often disrupt networks by overloading servers and causing system failures.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Disguised as legitimate software to trick users into downloading them. Once installed, Trojans provide attackers with unauthorised access to the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts a victim’s files, holding them hostage until a ransom is paid. Ransomware is a growing threat to businesses, hospitals, and even governments.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly monitors user activity and captures sensitive information such as login credentials, financial data, and browsing habits. It is often installed without the user’s knowledge.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Adware:</strong> Displays unwanted ads on a user’s device. While often less harmful, some adware collects user data without consent.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Rootkits:</strong> Grants attackers deep-level control of a system, often evading detection by security software. Rootkits enable long-term exploitation of compromised systems.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Malware spreads through phishing emails, malicious websites, infected USB drives, or compromised software downloads. Once inside a system, it can lead to financial loss, data theft, reputational damage, and operational disruptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To protect against malware:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                            <li>Use reliable antivirus and anti-malware software.</li>
                            <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading files from untrusted sources.</li>
                            <li>Keep your software and systems updated to close security gaps.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Malware is a constantly evolving threat, but vigilance and proactive security measures can significantly reduce your risk.

                        <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Use Strong and Unique Passwords:</strong> Opt for long, complex passwords and avoid reusing them across accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Educate Yourself and Your Team:</strong> Awareness is a powerful defense. Learn to recognise phishing attempts, suspicious links, and other common cyber threats.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Practice IoT Security:</strong> Change default passwords on smart devices, and regularly update IoT firmware to close security gaps.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Avoid accessing sensitive accounts or data on public networks. If necessary, use a VPN to encrypt your connection.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
