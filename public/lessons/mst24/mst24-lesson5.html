                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">What is the Internet?</h3>
                <p>The Internet is more than just the medium we use to check emails or stream videos. At its core, it’s a global network of interconnected computers and servers. It facilitates communication, allows the sharing of information, and connects businesses, academics, governments, and individuals worldwide. Picture a vast web of physical and wireless connections—copper telephone wires, fibre optic cables, Wi-Fi networks—all working together to make seamless communication possible.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">A Network of Networks</h4>
                <p>Why do we call it a network? Because it links millions of smaller networks into one expansive ecosystem. Whether it’s through routers, switches, or even satellite links, the Internet provides a foundation for accessing the vast pool of online resources. Every action, whether visiting a website or sending a message, is part of this intricate system.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Historical Milestones</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">

            <section data-scroll-reveal="enter from-left">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">Internet Infrastructure</h3>
                <p>To truly understand the Internet, it’s essential to unpack the components and systems that make it function.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">How Does the Internet Work?</h4>
                <p>At the heart of the Internet lies the <strong>client-server model</strong>:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Servers:</strong> These are powerful computers that store data and services, such as websites, files, and applications. When you type a URL or click on a link, you're essentially requesting information stored on a server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clients:</strong> Devices like laptops, smartphones, or tablets that request this information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These interactions occur within milliseconds, creating the seamless experience we often take for granted.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Key Components of the Internet</h4>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>ISP (Internet Service Provider):</strong> These companies connect homes and businesses to the Internet. Think of them as the bridge between users and the wider web.</li>
                    <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> This system translates user-friendly web addresses (like <em>www.example.com</em>) into numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate each other.</li>
                    <li><strong>Routers and Switches:</strong> These devices direct data traffic, ensuring it flows efficiently between clients and servers.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">How Do We Connect to the Internet?</h4>
                <p>Connection starts with your <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong>. They establish the link between your home or workplace and the global Internet, using various technologies:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Wired options:</strong> Fibre optic cables or DSL provide stable, high-speed connections.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Once connected, your device communicates with servers using protocols like HTTP and FTP to fetch or transmit data.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">The Role of Data Transmission</h4>
                <p>Data on the Internet travels in small packets. These packets follow routes determined by:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Protocols:</strong> Sets of rules, such as TCP/IP, that ensure data is organized and delivered accurately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Routers, switches, and undersea cables that guide packets across the globe.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This infrastructure ensures that even complex tasks like live video streaming happen in real-time.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">Web Browsers and Search Engines</h3>
                <p>The Internet’s vastness would be overwhelming without tools to navigate it. That’s where web browsers and search engines come in, serving as the primary interface between users and the World Wide Web.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">What Are Web Browsers?</h4>
                <p>A web browser is a software application that retrieves and displays content from the World Wide Web. Think of it as your window to the digital world, translating raw data from servers into user-friendly webpages.</p>
                <p>Examples of popular web browsers include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Google Chrome:</strong> Known for its speed and integration with Google services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox:</strong> Praised for its customizability and open-source nature.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safari:</strong> The go-to browser for Apple device users.</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">How Browsers Work</h4>
                <p>When you enter a URL or click on a link, the browser performs several tasks:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Resolving the URL:</strong> The browser communicates with the DNS to find the corresponding IP address.</li>
                    <li><strong>Requesting Data:</strong> Using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS, it fetches the webpage content from the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rendering the Page:</strong> It translates the received HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into the interactive webpage you see.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">What Are Search Engines?</h4>
                <p>Search engines are specialized tools designed to sift through the vast Internet and retrieve relevant results based on your queries. Unlike browsers, which focus on displaying webpages, search engines index and organize information.</p>
                <p>Popular search engines include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Google:</strong> The dominant player, known for its unmatched speed and relevance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bing:</strong> Offers integration with Microsoft products and unique features like image-based search.</li>
                    <li><strong>DuckDuckGo:</strong> Prioritizes user privacy by not tracking search history or collecting personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">How Search Engines Make Money</h4>
                <p>Search engines primarily earn revenue through:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Advertisements:</strong> Sponsored results appear alongside organic search listings. Companies pay to have their links displayed prominently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Some search engines collect user data to provide targeted ads. However, privacy-focused engines like DuckDuckGo avoid this practice.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Importance in Modern Life</h4>
                <p>Web browsers and search engines are indispensable tools. They simplify access to information, enable online research, and provide a gateway to countless services. Whether you're working, learning, or simply exploring, these tools are the Internet’s navigational compass.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-4">The World Wide Web</h3>
                <p>The Internet is the infrastructure, but the World Wide Web is the content we interact with daily. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they are distinct yet interdependent.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">What is the World Wide Web?</h4>
                <p>The World Wide Web, commonly referred to as the Web, is an information system where documents and other resources are stored on servers and accessed via the Internet. It uses hyperlinks to connect pages, making it possible to navigate seamlessly between them.</p>
                <p>Key elements of the Web include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Computers that host websites and provide their content upon request.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Pages:</strong> Individual documents, often written in HTML, that make up websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>URLs (Uniform Resource Locators):</strong> These act as addresses, helping browsers locate specific web pages.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">How the Web Works</h4>
                <p>When you type a URL into your browser, several steps occur:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>DNS Lookup:</strong> The browser contacts the Domain Name System to find the IP address of the web server hosting the requested resource.</li>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Request:</strong> The browser sends a request to the server, asking for the webpage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server Response:</strong> The server delivers the requested content, usually in the form of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> The browser processes the files and displays the content in a readable format.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">The Evolution of the Web</h4>
                <p>Since its creation by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, the Web has undergone several transformations:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Web 1.0 (The Static Web):</strong> Early websites were simple, read-only pages with minimal interactivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web 2.0 (The Social Web):</strong> Introduced user-generated content, social media, and dynamic web applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web 3.0 (The Semantic Web):</strong> The ongoing evolution aims to create a more intelligent and interconnected Web, driven by AI and blockchain technologies.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">The Role of Websites</h4>
                <p>Websites are collections of related web pages under a single domain name, like <em>www.example.com</em>. They serve various purposes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Informational:</strong> Providing news, blogs, and educational content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transactional:</strong> Facilitating online shopping and financial services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive:</strong> Hosting social media platforms and collaborative tools.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">Why URLs Matter</h4>
                <p>A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a web page's address. It consists of:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 text-gray-800">
                    <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> Specifies how data is transferred (e.g., HTTP or HTTPS).</li>
                    <li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> Identifies the website (e.g., <em>example.com</em>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Path:</strong> Points to a specific resource on the server (e.g., <em>/about</em>).</li>
                </ul>
