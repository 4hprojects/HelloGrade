            <!-- Section 1: Introduction -->
            <section >
                <p>
                    Imagine this: <strong>90% of all software decisions</strong> are driven by conditional logic. Whether it's a simple app or a complex AI system, conditional statements are the backbone of decision-making in programming. They're the reason your GPS reroutes when there's traffic, your email filters spam, and your favorite streaming service recommends the next show to binge. Without them, code would be static, lifeless, and utterly predictable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But here's the thing—conditional statements aren't just about making decisions. They're about making <em>smart</em> decisions. And in Python, they're incredibly intuitive and powerful. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, mastering Python conditional statements can transform the way you write code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this guide, we'll dive deep into <strong>Python conditional statements</strong>, exploring everything from the basics of <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> to advanced techniques like nested conditionals. You'll learn how to write cleaner, more efficient code that responds dynamically to real-world scenarios. By the end, you'll not only understand how to use these tools but also why they're essential for building robust, intelligent applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's get started—because great code doesn't just happen; it's built on smart decisions.
                </p>
            </section>
    
            <!-- Section 2: Why Conditional Statements Matter in Python -->
            <section class="mt-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-4">Why Conditional Statements Matter in Python</h3>
                <p>
                    Think of conditional statements as the <strong>decision-makers</strong> of your code. They evaluate conditions and execute specific actions based on whether those conditions are true or false. In Python, this is done using <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> statements. These tools allow your program to adapt, react, and make choices—just like you do every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, consider a traffic light system. If the light is green, you go. If it's red, you stop. If it's yellow, you prepare to stop. This simple logic is the foundation of countless real-world applications, from user authentication to data validation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But here's the kicker: <strong>conditional statements aren't just about binary choices</strong>. They can handle complex, multi-layered decisions with ease. Want to check the weather <em>and</em> the type of event before deciding what to wear? Python's got you covered. Need to evaluate multiple grades and provide tailored feedback? Conditional statements make it happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next sections, we'll break down the syntax, explore practical examples, and show you how to leverage these tools to write smarter, more efficient code.

                <!-- Section 3: The Building Blocks of Python Conditional Statements -->
                <section  class="mt-8">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-4">The Building Blocks of Python Conditional Statements</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the heart of Python conditional statements are three key components: <strong><code>if</code></strong>, <strong><code>elif</code></strong>, and <strong><code>else</code></strong>. These are the tools you'll use to create decision-making logic in your code.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                        <li>
                            <strong><code>if</code> statements</strong> are your starting point. They check a condition and execute a block of code if that condition is true.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><code>elif</code> statements</strong> (short for "else if") allow you to check multiple conditions in sequence. They're perfect for handling more complex decision trees.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><code>else</code> statements</strong> act as a catch-all. They execute a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Here's a quick example to illustrate:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
                        <code class="text-sm">
    traffic_light = 'green'
    
    if traffic_light == 'green':
        print("Go!")
    elif traffic_light == 'red':
        print("Stop!")
    else:
        print("Prepare to stop.")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        In this example, the program checks the value of <code>traffic_light</code> and prints the appropriate action. It's simple, intuitive, and incredibly powerful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Python conditional statements go beyond basic syntax. They're about creating logic that's both efficient and easy to understand. And that's where the real magic happens.

               <!-- Section 4: Practical Applications of Python Conditional Statements -->
               <section class="mt-8">
                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-4">Practical Applications of Python Conditional Statements</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's take a closer look at how Python conditional statements can be applied in real-world scenarios.
                </p>

                <!-- Subsection 1: Traffic Light System -->
                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">1. Traffic Light System</h4>
                    <p>
                        Imagine you're building a traffic light simulation. Using conditional statements, you can create a system that responds dynamically to changing lights:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
                        <code class="text-sm">
def traffic_light_action(light):
    if light == 'green':
        print("Go!")
    elif light == 'red':
        print("Stop!")
    elif light == 'yellow':
        print("Prepare to stop.")
    else:
        print("Invalid light color.")

traffic_light_action('green')  # Output: Go!
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This simple function demonstrates how conditional statements can be used to handle multiple scenarios with ease.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Subsection 2: Weather-Based Outfit Selector -->
                <div class="mb-6">
                    <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-2">2. Weather-Based Outfit Selector</h4>
                    <p>
                        Another practical example is a program that helps you decide what to wear based on the weather and the type of event:
                    </p>
                    <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
                        <code class="text-sm">
weather = 'rainy'
event = 'formal'

if weather == 'sunny':
    if event == 'casual':
        print("Wear sunglasses and a t-shirt.")
    elif event == 'formal':
        print("Wear sunglasses and a formal suit.")
elif weather == 'rainy':
    if event == 'casual':
        print("Carry an umbrella and wear waterproof boots.")
    elif event == 'formal':
        print("Carry an umbrella and wear a waterproof coat.")
else:
    print("Weather not recognized.")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        This example uses <strong>nested conditional statements</strong> to handle multiple layers of decision-making. It's a powerful technique that allows you to create complex logic while keeping your code organized and readable.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>
            
                        <!-- Section 5: Advanced Techniques: Nested Conditional Statements -->
                        <section  class="mt-8">
                            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-600 mb-4">Advanced Techniques: Nested Conditional Statements</h3>
                            <p>
                                Nested conditional statements take your decision-making to the next level. They allow you to check multiple conditions within other conditions, creating a hierarchy of logic that can handle even the most complex scenarios.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, let's say you're building an academic performance analyzer. You want to provide tailored feedback based on a student's grade:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
                                <code class="text-sm">
            grade = 88
            
            if grade >= 70:
                if grade >= 85:
                    print("Excellent performance!")
                else:
                    print("Good performance!")
            elif grade >= 50:
                print("Satisfactory performance, but room for improvement.")
            else:
                print("Unsatisfactory performance, needs improvement.")
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                In this example, the program first checks if the grade is above 70. If it is, it then checks whether the grade is above 85 to provide more specific feedback. This layered approach ensures that your code is both precise and flexible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nested conditional statements are particularly useful when you need to make decisions that depend on multiple layers of conditions. For instance, deciding what to wear based on the weather <em>and</em> the type of event you're attending requires nested logic:
                            </p>
                            <pre class="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-4">
                                <code class="text-sm">
            weather = 'rainy'
            event = 'formal'
            
            if weather == 'sunny':
                if event == 'casual':
                    print("Wear sunglasses and a t-shirt.")
                elif event == 'formal':
                    print("Wear sunglasses and a formal suit.")
            elif weather == 'rainy':
                if event == 'casual':
                    print("Carry an umbrella and wear waterproof boots.")
                elif event == 'formal':
                    print("Carry an umbrella and wear a waterproof coat.")
            else:
                print("Weather not recognized.")
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                This example demonstrates how nested conditionals can handle multiple layers of decision-making, ensuring that your code remains organized and easy to understand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By mastering nested conditional statements, you can create more sophisticated and dynamic programs that respond intelligently to a wide range of scenarios.
